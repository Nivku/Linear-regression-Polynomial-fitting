# Linear & Polynomial fitting
## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing linear regression and polynomial fitting models.
The primary objective is to fit these models to real-world datasets, addressing challenges typical of practical scenarios,
and gain insights into feature selection and model performance.

### Project Scope

The tasks encompass several key objectives:

∙ Implementation of linear & polynomial regression models components as specified.
∙ Data preprocessing and exploration to handle noise, missing values, and feature engineering.
∙ Feature selection and evaluation to identify relevant predictors for the target variable.
∙ Model training, evaluation, and comparison across different subsets of the dataset.
∙ Analysis of model performance variations, including the impact of polynomial degree and training-test split.
